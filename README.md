# Compiler Ruby

Welcome to the Compiler Ruby repository! 🛠️💎 This project provides a framework and tools for creating and working with compilers using Ruby. Designed for developers interested in compiler theory and implementation, this project offers a practical approach to building compilers in Ruby.

## 📜 Overview

The Compiler Ruby project includes the necessary tools and libraries to design, implement, and test compilers for various programming languages. It covers the basic components of a compiler such as lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenize input source code into meaningful symbols using a lexer.
- **Parsing:** Build abstract syntax trees (ASTs) from tokenized input using a parser.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Analyze the syntax and semantics of the code to ensure correctness.
- **Code Generation:** Generate intermediate code or machine code from the AST.
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error reporting for syntax and semantic errors.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Comprehensive documentation and example projects to help you get started.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with Compiler Ruby, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/compiler-ruby.git
   cd compiler-ruby
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Ruby 3.0 or later installed. Install the required gems:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run the Compiler:**
   Use the provided script to compile source code:
   ```bash
   ruby compiler.rb --input path/to/your/source_code.lang --output path/to/output/compiled_code
   ```
