Introduction
compiler-ruby is a Ruby-based compiler designed to process and execute Ruby code efficiently. This project provides a framework for compiling Ruby source code into intermediate representations or bytecode, enabling optimized execution and deeper analysis of Ruby programs. It is a valuable tool for developers looking to explore compiler construction, optimize Ruby code, or develop custom Ruby-based languages and tools.

Features
Source Code Compilation: Translates Ruby source code into an intermediate representation or bytecode for enhanced execution efficiency.
Optimization: Includes optimization techniques to improve performance and reduce the execution time of compiled Ruby code.
Intermediate Representations: Supports various intermediate representations to facilitate code analysis and transformation.
Custom Extensions: Allows for the addition of custom compilation passes or transformations to tailor the compiler to specific needs.
Error Handling: Provides detailed error messages and diagnostics to assist with debugging and improving code quality.
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed guides and examples for setting up the compiler, compiling Ruby code, and extending functionality.
